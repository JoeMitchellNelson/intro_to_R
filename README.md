# Intro to R
A resource to help interested students get acquainted with R

## Install R and RStudio

You'll need to install R (the language) and RStudio (the IDE). Both are free. [Instructions for installing both can be found here.](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/installing-R-windows-mac-ubuntu)

## Install Git

Projects in R don't typically rely on a single file, but instead a set of files that work in tandem. For example, you might store data in one file, while R code to process that data is stored in another file. Storing projects in a git repository keeps sets of files organized. Git offers other benefits: your work lives in "the cloud," so it is always backed up, git offers branching abilities that allow multiple collaborators to work on a project at the same time, and git allows a single programmer to switch between machines easily (for example, between a work computer and a home computer).

## Play with some code

In the bottom right panel in RStudio, click the Files tab, then click `make_plot.R`. The comments in that file will lead you from there.
